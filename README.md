## MultiSig Wallet

Multisig in Solidity is a way to implement multi-signature wallets. A multi-signature wallet is a type of wallet that requires multiple signatures to authorize transactions. This can be useful for businesses or organizations that want to add an extra layer of security to their financial transactions.

To implement multisig in Solidity, this smart contract stores the addresses of the authorized signers and the required number of signatures. The smart contract will only execute transactions if the required number of signatures have been provided.
